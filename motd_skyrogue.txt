1.1.6 Released!

You may need to rebind your controls if you are not using defaults; custom control bindings were being saved to the Windows registry (and other places on other platforms). They are now stored in PlayerProfile.sav so that they are preserved by Steam Cloud.

- Fixed "forced to use mouse" bug!
- Co-op fixes!
- Zulu upgrades fixed!

Full changelist on the Steam page!
