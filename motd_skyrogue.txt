1.1.6 Released!

- You may need to rebind your controls if you are not using defaults; custom control bindings were being saved to the Windows registry (and other places on other platforms). They are now stored in PlayerProfile.sav so that they are preserved by Steam Cloud.
- Landing is done with the button bound to "UISubmit" instead of the one bound to "Target". This should help if you have rebound the "Target" button.
- Fixed an issue where the game would not respond to joystick controls and only accept mouse input in certain cases, requiring you to disable the mouse entirely.
- Co-op fixes!
- Zulu upgrades fixed!
